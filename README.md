# 👨‍⚕️💉🩺 Virtual Radiologist 👨‍⚕️💉🩺

## Introduction

With the use of artificial intelligence, Virtual Radiologist can identify pneumonia and brain tumours using X-rays. Many instances are overlooked in their early stages because X-ray detection is difficult. Detecting Pneumonia and Brain Tumors early on might save the lives of those who are suffering from them. This is where Deep-learning comes in. The depth of deep-learning networks distinguishes them from single-hidden-layer neural networks, which are more frequent.
